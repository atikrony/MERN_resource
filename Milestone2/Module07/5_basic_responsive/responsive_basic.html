          Healthy food refers to a variety of nutritious and balanced meals that
          provide the body with essential vitamins, minerals, proteins, and
          energy. It includes fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean
          proteins, and healthy fats, all of which support overall physical and
          mental well-being. Eating healthy food helps maintain a strong immune
          system, improves digestion, boosts energy levels, and reduces the risk
          of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. A
          good diet also plays a key role in enhancing concentration and mood.
          Choosing natural, less processed foods and drinking enough water are
          simple but effective steps toward a healthier lifestyle.
